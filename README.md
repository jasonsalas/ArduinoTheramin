ArduinoTheramin
===============

Using an Arduino Esplora's photoresistor to create a DIY theramin

I've always wanted to play a theremin (aka, an etherphone - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin), the wackiest instrument ever and a big staple of cartoon sound effects. 

So I made my own...and I even added a synchronized light show. Go me.
